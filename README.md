# WebDNA Language Extension for VSCode README
This is a language extension for VSCode that will perform syntax highlighting on [WebDNA](http://www.webdna.us/) code. It is very much a work in progress and should be considered a 'beta' build as not everything is fully implemented or even tested!<br/>
